# 2DHeatEquation

Objective 1 : Solving the 2D Heat Conduction Equation in steady state and unsteady(transient) forms using implicit and explicit schemes.
1. Steady State Solution schemes (Only Implicit): Gauss Jacobi; Gauss Siedel; Successive Over-relaxation
2. Transient Solution schemes: Matrix Inversion (Implicit); Explicit method

Objective 2 : Analyze the steady state solutions and transient solutions

Things to remember:

1. 'Report.pdf' has all the plots and equations.
2. 'explicit_method.m' and 'implicit_method.m' are the main MATLAB files.
